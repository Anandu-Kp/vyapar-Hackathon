1. Overview
Feature Summary
The User Stage Report provides a detailed, stage-wise distribution of leads for each user within selected pipelines and campaigns. Admins can filter the data by date type (disposed_at, created_at, assigned_at), pipeline, campaign, and user. The report dynamically adjusts based on the selected filters and provides real-time insights into lead stages across the organization.
Business Objectives

5. Example Scenarios
5.1 Lead Movement Between Stages
When a lead moves from "Open" to "In Progress" within a selected date range:
The count for "Open" decreases by one.
The count for "In Progress" increases by one.
Counts reflect only the current stage of leads at the time of filtering.
Example:
On Day X:
Open = 6
In Progress = 5
On Day X+1 (after one lead moves):
Open = 5
In Progress = 6
